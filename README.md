# Hacktoberfest
Every October, Digital Ocean and GitHub ship out free Hacktoberfest shirts to thousands of people around the world.
I’ve gotten Hacktoberfest shirts the past two years, and I wear them with pride.
In this quick article, I’ll show you how you can get a Hacktoberfest shirt — even if you have never coded before.
The bottom line is this: if you can open 5 pull requests by October 31 — and I’ll walk you through how to do this — you can get your own Hacktoberfest shirt shipped to your door for free
Step #1: Register for Hacktoberfest
You need a GitHub account. If you don’t have one yet, you can create one for free in just a few minutes.
Then go to the Hacktoberfest registration page and follow the instructions. It only takes a moment.
Step #2: Learn how to make a pull request
Pull requests are a way of contributing your code changes to an open source project. They use a tool called Git, which runs on a social coding platform called GitHub.
GitHub is the center of the open source universe, and is home to projects like Linux and React.js.
It can take months for developers to get good enough to contribute to some of these projects. But the freeCodeCamp community has made it easy for absolute beginners to contribute to our open source project.
You can contribute to freeCodeCamp right in your browser on GitHub. You don’t need to install anything on your computer. You don’t even need to know a programming language. You just need to choose an article you want to help improve.
